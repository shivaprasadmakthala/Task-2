 3.     Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript,          Require object is predefined in Node which is used to include  
                   i.e. in browsers.                                                          modules  in the app.

 4.   Window is a predefined global object which has functions     Node doesn’t have a predefined window object cause it doesn’t 
         and attributes, that have to deal with window                                have a window to draw anything.
             that has been drawn.                                                          

 5.   Location is another predefined object in browsers, that       Location object is related to a particular url; that means it is 
        has all the information about the url we have loaded.                 for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
